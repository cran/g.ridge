Description: Ridge regression due to Hoerl and Kennard (1970)<DOI:10.1080/00401706.1970.10488634> and generalized ridge regression due to Yang and Emura (2017)<DOI:10.1080/03610918.2016.1193195> with optimized tuning parameters.
 These ridge regression estimators (the HK estimator and the YE estimator) are computed by minimizing the cross-validated mean squared errors.
 Both the ridge and generalized ridge estimators are applicable for high-dimensional regressors (p>n), where p is the number of regressors, and n is the sample size.
